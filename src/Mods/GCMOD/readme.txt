Echo and the Trench. The Empire needs one of the forward bases, plus the trench to cause 

ticket drain on the rebels. The Empire can cause ticket loss by owning only Echo base, as 

well. The Rebels must control the Trench, Echo, and one other base to cause the Empire to 

loose tickets.

does. 

-ATST Commander position (Top) #3 now can call in artillery! It is a scout, after all.

place of the grenade. 

-If your team holds Jabba's palace, and the sail barge is not being crewed by enemy forces, 

you now have a 1 in 4 change of spawning directly into the Sail barge when choosing to spawn 

at Jabba's. Regardless of where the Sail Barge is on the map.

-Speeder Bike now fires from only one location (centered). 

-Imperial Landing craft no longer leans to the left. Fixed sound issues. 

-Capital ships should no longer have the SPIN grief bug. They now only turn with forward 

momentum, which means the faster you go forward the better they turn. If you come to a stop, 

be aware you need time to build up speed to turn again. This should make battles more 

interesting. Also, you can no longer maneuver outside the top grid. The flaps won't react 

that high.

-Sail Barge deck gun no longer has splash, so you don't fry the deck crew while using it.

motion. The pilot still is above deck.

stop using reverse.. hey, we've made a few special modifications. The seat texture is also 

back.

 now.

-New artwork added for each custom player class. Custom backpacks, and hippacks. Head gear 

for rebel. 

-Hoth rebels now have warm ears again. (Hats won't change teams with packs now).

-Heavy Infantry packs added to Echo base (back rooms) and to Dantooine,
 (in the two imperial outpost bases, once you capture them.) They will spawn
 based on the team that is holding the flag. TL-21 or Tracker 16.

-DeathStar updated: TL positions, health of objective, difficulty.
