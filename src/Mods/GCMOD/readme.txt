
PLEASE READ THE GC MANUAL (located in the gc_manual folder in your GCMOD directory) for 

information on how to play the game. This update log has only a list of changes between versions. With over 50 vehicles, with unique flying controls, and so many custom player abilities and gameplay types, you really need to read the manual to get the most out of GC.

-Many of the Tatooine meshes have been optimized, and reduced. Less lag.

-Many other meshes have also been optimized. 

-New Bacta tank in Echo base. New code.

number of warheads Rebels carry.

-Tanaab Objectives (In the labs) are easier to destroy if you can get in.

-Hoth flag capture values changed. The Rebels can hold their flags steady by defending only 

Echo and the Trench. The Empire needs one of the forward bases, plus the trench to cause 

ticket drain on the rebels. The Empire can cause ticket loss by owning only Echo base, as 

well. The Rebels must control the Trench, Echo, and one other base to cause the Empire to 

loose tickets. 

-Beggars Canyon now spawns a full Gunship in place of the Lambda, totally decked out.

-Fog adjusted on many maps to better match skybox.

-Bespin has had the Engineer replaced with HeavyWeapons, more fitting for the map, and 
  removes the cloud-bus explosion pack spamming/healing on non-friendly fire servers.

-Mon Cal now spawns 2 boats at each spawn point. So each small island now will be able to 

have 4 active boats at a time, greatly increasing transportation.

-StrongLasers (sail barge, AV) now do more damage to Medium and Light armor. 

-Lightlaser now does slightly less damage. 

-ATST had it's health increased, as people said it was to weak vs. Aircraft and medium 

lasers.

-ATST no longer does splash damage on it's main gun. However, the Number 2 position still 

does. 

-ATST Commander position (Top) #3 now can call in artillery! It is a scout, after all.

-ATST-V added to the game. This is a version of the ATST on Dantooine that packs a rocket in 

place of the grenade. 

-If your team holds Jabba's palace, and the sail barge is not being crewed by enemy forces, 

you now have a 1 in 4 change of spawning directly into the Sail barge when choosing to spawn 

at Jabba's. Regardless of where the Sail Barge is on the map.

-Collision meshes inside of the Lambda, and Sailbarge no longer hurt players that stand on 

them while the craft is moving.  

-Tie Fighter Exit point moved to fix exploit.

-Speeder Bike now fires from only one location (centered). 

-Imperial Landing craft no longer leans to the left. Fixed sound issues. 

-Capital ships should no longer have the SPIN grief bug. They now only turn with forward 

momentum, which means the faster you go forward the better they turn. If you come to a stop, 

be aware you need time to build up speed to turn again. This should make battles more 

interesting. Also, you can no longer maneuver outside the top grid. The flaps won't react 

that high.

-Sail Barge deck gun no longer has splash, so you don't fry the deck crew while using it. 

-Sail Barge crew members now all uncrew below deck, safe from dyeing while the SB is in 

motion. The pilot still is above deck. 

-The MF now has a vertical take off, using the right mouse button. It still has the rapid 

stop using reverse.. hey, we've made a few special modifications. The seat texture is also 

back. 

-R2 Repair rate in the X-Wing and Y-Wing increased. Should be more viable a tool
 now.

-YWing top gun given a power boost. Should be more effective against fighters.

-YWing health increased slightly. 

-All droid controllers should now be distortable, and small again.

-Probe droid now has half the health it originally did.

-Disruptors, Gasgrenades, Lethal_Injection, Shields, sprinting, and more added. See manual.

-Icon added for Vibroblade. No longer the BF knife.

-New artwork added for each custom player class. Custom backpacks, and hippacks. Head gear 

for rebel. 

-Hoth rebels now have warm ears again. (Hats won't change teams with packs now).

-Heavy Infantry packs added to Echo base (back rooms) and to Dantooine,
 (in the two imperial outpost bases, once you capture them.) They will spawn
 based on the team that is holding the flag. TL-21 or Tracker 16.

-DeathStar updated: TL positions, health of objective, difficulty. 

-Loaders added for Anchorhead and Lok. Still WIP, may add more later. 

-The Sarlaac is now awake, and hungry. One tentacle is known to bury in the sand
 a bit to much.
